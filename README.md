# HWSTC-patcher
Aspect Ratio and Resolution Patcher for Hot Wheels: Stunt Track Challenge


# What is it?
HWSTC-patcher is a program for patching the 2004 game [Hot Wheels: Stunt Track Challenge](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Hot_Wheels:_Stunt_Track_Challenge) to support higher resolutions and different aspect ratios.

# How do I use it?
1. Download the release .zip, extract, and run the exe.
2. Select the install directory for HWSTC
3. Choose the desired aspect ratio and resolution
4. Click patch.
If all goes well, your game should be good to go! 

# Why does this need Admin Rights?
To put it simply, it is impossible to edit registry values without administrative access. Without this, the game's resolution cannot be set. I don't know why the game's video settings are stored in the registry, but they are.

# Items Not Fixed
* CD Check
  * I plan on working on this, but no timeline
* Launcher Hardware Check
  * I also plan on addressing this at some point, but again no estimate
  * In the meantime, use the [AutoHotKey script found here.](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Hot_Wheels:_Stunt_Track_Challenge#Launcher_may_fail_hardware_check)

# Special Thanks
* [AuToMaNiAk005](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgSunVswSNC4e-Xac1aoz3g) - This project would have quite literally been impossible without his work. He's the one who found all of the bytes to modify back in 2017:
  * [Hot Wheels Stunt Track Challenge - Widescreen Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnpnmJvG9BI)
* The original Climax Racing team. This game did not have to be as sick as it is.
